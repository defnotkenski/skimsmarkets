"""Tennis lens set — three bespoke specs.

Each `LensSpec` carries:
- `fetcher_system_builder` — the prompt builder for the cached fetcher
  system block, parameterized by the provider's tool prose.
- `reasoner_system` — the cached system prompt for the Claude reasoner.
- `report_schema` — the Pydantic class the reasoner returns.
- `render_extras` — per-lens user-message append. Two lenses currently
  wire one: `tennis_form_and_surface` gets the FULL stats block;
  `tennis_conditions_and_context` gets a NARROW fatigue-only slice.
  `tennis_matchup_and_clutch` has no structured render and pulls its
  primitives via the fetcher's web search.
- `fetcher_sport_hint` / `reasoner_sport_hint` — per-lens sport-specific
  guidance, ride on the user message (never the cached system block).

Why two `render_extras` callables on the same data source?
Same source, two scoped views. The full block contains form/surface
stats, matchup-conditioned stats, and primitives the conditions lens
also cares about (`last_match_date`, `recent_matches` for fatigue).
Piping the FULL block to all three lenses would breach the silo
without buying material data; routing nothing to conditions wastes
the fatigue primitives the vendor already ships. The split:
form_and_surface gets the full block (it owns the plurality of
fields); conditions gets a narrow fatigue-only render derived from
the same source data; matchup_and_clutch gets nothing structured and
web-searches its primitives via the fetcher. This preserves the
silo posture from CLAUDE.md — each lens sees only what it needs.

_FETCHER_HINT_FORM_AND_SURFACE = """
Tennis form-and-surface specifics:
- Surface-conditioned form is the load-bearing primitive. ATP/WTA stats are
  surface-segregated for a reason — recent on-surface form (hard / clay /
  grass / carpet) outweighs YTD aggregates. Lift the on-surface W-L
  directly from `surface_win_loss[surface]` in the structured block.
- Tier records (`record_at_grand_slam`, `record_at_masters`,
  `record_vs_top_5`, `record_vs_top_10`) tell you whether form translates
  against quality competition at this stage. Use them when the sample is
  ≥10 matches.
- Career serve metrics (1st-serve in%, 1st/2nd-serve points won%) and
  career return metrics (1st/2nd-serve return won%) are CAREER aggregates
  in the structured block. A player on a hot serving stretch may be
  over-performing them right now; web-search recent results to flag this.
- Sources for color the structured block doesn't carry: tennisabstract.com
  (Elo + surface splits), ATP/WTA official, Infosys ATP stats,
  flashscore for recent results.
- code_execution: surface-conditioned Elo, recent-form-weighted baseline.
  Surface candidates labeled clearly (e.g. `team_a_baseline_elo_clay`,
  `team_a_baseline_log5_recent_8`) so the reasoner can pick the most
  defensible. Log5 is awkward for tennis — surface-conditioned win-rate
  is the cleaner baseline.
- DO NOT push for surface-effect MAGNITUDE in your `form_signed_shift` —
  that's `surface_signed_shift`'s job (also from this lens, but separate
  field). The form shift is about RECENT QUALITY (last 10 matches, loss
  color, training-block disruptions); the surface shift is about
  THIS-SURFACE FIT (career and YTD splits on this surface).
""".strip()


_FETCHER_HINT_MATCHUP_AND_CLUTCH = """
Tennis matchup-and-clutch specifics:
- H2H samples are small but predictive. The structured block ships
  total H2H + per-surface H2H + 3 most recent meetings (date, winner,
  surface, round, score). Cite both lifetime AND on-surface H2H, but
  remember: the form lens owns surface-effect magnitude, so your
  numeric `h2h_signed_shift` should NOT push for surface — surface H2H
  informs your reasoning qualitatively only.
- In-matchup clutch (deciders, tiebreaks, comeback %, closeout %, bo3
  vs bo5 records) is sharper signal than career-wide BP %. The
  structured block ships these per-player conditioned on THIS opponent —
  a player who's 67% in deciders overall but 33% in deciders against
  this specific opponent gives you a real edge.
- Handedness (`plays`) drives game-style fit: lefty crosscourt forehand
  attacks one-handed-backhand defenders. Big-server vs returner: a
  high-1st-serve-in% / low-return-pts-won% server vs a high-1st-serve-
  return-won% returner is a tightly contested matchup; tiebreaks
  decide it.
- Tournament tier shapes variance: Slam best-of-5 reduces upset rate
  (more chances for the higher-quality player to assert), but
  amplifies fatigue/injury risk if either player is marginal. Tour
  best-of-3 has more variance; tiebreak skill is more decisive.
- Sources: tennisabstract.com (H2H + matchup splits), ATP/WTA H2H
  pages, recent-meeting recaps in tennis press.
- code_execution: H2H-conditioned win-rate, decider-record fit
  (binomial confidence intervals when N is small), comeback-rate
  comparison.
""".strip()


_FETCHER_HINT_CONDITIONS_AND_CONTEXT = """
Tennis conditions-and-context specifics:
- Court conditions are quantitative form adjustments, not storylines.
  Heat slows hard / clay; wind on outdoor sessions hurts the bigger
  server; clay drying speed after rain shifts the pace; roof open vs
  closed at Wimbledon Centre / Rod Laver shifts ball flight; altitude
  at Madrid / Indian Wells inflates flat shots. Pull current/forecast
  conditions and surface their expected impact in `computed_numbers`
  (e.g. `wind_serve_drag_<player>`, `heat_hold_pct_adjust_<player>`).
- Tennis injuries are often hidden until match-time. Check for
  medical timeouts in recent matches, retirement frequency in the
  last 90 days, and withdrawals from preceding events on the same
  swing. Body-part / surface interaction shapes magnitude: shoulder /
  wrist issues spike serve breakdown (bigger on hard / grass); lower-
  body issues are bigger on clay (longer rallies, more sliding).
- Fatigue from prior round is real and quantifiable. `days_since_last_match`
  and `match_count_last_14d` per player are PRE-COMPUTED in the
  structured Tennis-fatigue block on this user message — use those
  primitives directly, don't re-discover them via web search.
  back-to-back days = cumulative fatigue (look for ≤1d gap and ≥4
  matches in last 14d); long layoff = rust risk (≥10d gap is
  meaningful). Web-search ONLY for fatigue inputs NOT in the
  structured block: tournament-cumulative sets/games/minutes
  played-so-far, travel/timezone shift since last tournament,
  retirement frequency in trailing 90d, and medical timeouts taken in
  recent matches — these are off MatchStat's surface.
- Stakes and motivation: defending finalist points, race-to-Finals
  cutoff (October-November), defending the title, first-time
  finalist nerves, post-Slam letdown, end-of-season tank.
- Coaching changes mid-season often signal technical recalibration in
  progress — flag them in `stakes_summary` (NOT in the physical
  shift; coaching is technical disruption, not availability).
- Sources: ATP/WTA official notices, beat reporters (José Morgado,
  Christopher Clarey, Ben Rothenberg), player social media (Twitter /
  Instagram stories often leak warm-up issues), weather.com /
  Météo-France for outdoor-session forecasts, tennis press for stakes
  context.
- code_execution: tour-baseline retirement rate is ~3-5% of matches;
  flag players above baseline in the trailing 90d as withdrawal-
  risk-elevated.

Tennis form-and-surface calibration:
- `team_a_win_probability` BASELINE: anchor on rankings + surface fit
  ALONE. Don't pre-bake H2H, conditions, or stakes — those stack on top
  via the other lenses' shifts. A 600-rank gap between two healthy
  players on a neutral surface is typically a 0.70-0.80 baseline; a
  100-rank gap is typically 0.55-0.62.
- `form_signed_shift` magnitudes (toward team_a):
    * ≥+0.10 / ≤-0.10: clear form divergence (e.g. one player 8-1 with
      titles in the last 6 weeks; the other 1-4 with two retirements).
    * +0.05 to +0.10: meaningful form delta (one player on a winning
      stretch, the other not).
    * 0 to ±0.05: comparable form, no decisive recency edge.
- `surface_signed_shift` magnitudes:
    * ≥+0.07 / ≤-0.07: dominant surface specialist vs weak surface
      record (e.g. clay-courter vs hard-courter on clay).
    * +0.03 to +0.07: clear preference asymmetry but not specialist-
      level (one player 65%+ on this surface, the other 50%).
    * 0 to ±0.03: both players comfortable on this surface.
- `confidence`:
    * 'high': structured stats block is rich, computed candidates
      converge within 5pp, multiple surface seasons of data on both.
    * 'medium': structured block present but candidates span 5-10pp,
      or one player is a surface debutant.
    * 'low': structured block missing OR `coverage='thin'` OR
      candidates span >10pp.

_REASONER_HINT_MATCHUP_AND_CLUTCH = """
Tennis matchup-and-clutch calibration:
- `h2h_signed_shift` magnitudes (toward team_a):
    * ≥+0.10 / ≤-0.10: dominant H2H (≥4 meetings, lopsided record,
      and clear style fit favoring one side, e.g. lefty vs OHB
      defender). REMINDER: this is NOT surface-driven — even a
      surface-asymmetric H2H pushes via the form lens's surface
      shift, not here.
    * +0.05 to +0.10: meaningful H2H edge (3+ meetings, modest skew
      with style fit).
    * 0 to ±0.05: thin H2H or balanced record; rely on style flag and
      qualitative tactical fit.
- `clutch_signed_shift` magnitudes:
    * ≥+0.06 / ≤-0.06: clear clutch divergence — strongly prefer
      matchup-conditioned numbers (in-matchup decider %, in-matchup
      tiebreak %) when present. A 33% vs 67% in-matchup decider
      record is a genuine ~0.06-0.08 shift.
    * +0.02 to +0.06: career BP-save / BP-convert percentages

Tennis conditions-and-context calibration:
- `physical_signed_shift` magnitudes (toward team_a, combining
  fitness + court conditions):
    * ±0.13 to ±0.15 (cap): confirmed pre-match withdrawal /

    * ±0.06 to ±0.12: credible questionable tag with same-day
      warm-up issues; stacked fatigue + adverse weather for one side.
    * ±0.02 to ±0.06: fatigue from a back-to-back-day grind, or
      adverse weather (e.g. cold + wind for a big-server) without
      injury concerns.
    * 0 to ±0.02: comparable physical state, neutral conditions.
- Body-part / surface interaction: shoulder / wrist on hard / grass

  stronger.
- Best-of-5 (Slams) amplifies marginal-injury risk vs best-of-3 — push
  one band stronger on a marginal injury at a Slam vs a 250.
